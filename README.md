# Online Store App

## Project Overview

_The Online Store App is a modern e-commerce platform designed to provide users with a seamless shopping experience. It incorporates essential features such as product browsing, cart management, favorite items selection, and user authentication. The application aims to showcase best practices in React development and state management using Redux._

## Technologies Used

- **React:** _The application is built using React, a powerful and efficient JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React's component-based architecture allows for the creation of reusable and modular UI elements._

- **JavaScript:** _Various functionalities and utility functions are implemented in JavaScript to enhance the application's features._

- **Redux Toolkit:** _Redux is employed for state management, ensuring a centralized and predictable state container. The use of Redux Toolkit simplifies the implementation of Redux logic, making the codebase more maintainable._

- **React Router:** _Navigation is handled with React Router, enabling users to seamlessly move between different sections of the application without page reloads._

- **Axios:** _The axios library facilitates HTTP requests, enabling the app to interact with a backend server for data retrieval and updates._

- **CSS Modules:** _Component styling is organized using CSS modules, ensuring scoped and maintainable styles._

## Project Structure

- **_`src/components`:_** _Contains React components that compose the application's pages and UI elements, such as Home, Cart, Favorites, etc._

- **_`src/features`:_** _Manages the application state with Redux. The user, products, and categories slices handle user data, product information, and category details._

- **_`src/utils`:_** _Hosts utility functions for common tasks, including array shuffling (shuffle), URL construction (buildUrl), and numeric summation (sumBy)._

- **_`src/styles`:_** _Component styling is organized using CSS modules, ensuring scoped and maintainable styles._

- **_`public`:_** _Contains static assets, including images and fonts._

- **_`index.js`:_** _The main entry point of the application, initializing React and rendering the root component._

## Functionality

The Header component is a fundamental element in the Online Store App, offering key features for navigation and user interaction. It is structured as follows:

- **Logo:** Displays the app logo, serving as a link to the Home page.

- **User Information:** Shows the user's avatar and name. Clicking opens the user's profile (for logged-in users) or the Sign Up/In form (for guests).

- **Search Bar:** Includes a real-time search input for product discovery. Dynamically updates displayed products based on user input, with suggestions shown below.

- **Navigation Links:**

  - **Home:** Main landing page.
  - **Cart:** Navigates to the Cart page.
  - **Favorites:** Directs to the Favorites page.

- **Cart and Favorites Icons:** Quick access to Cart and Favorites, with the cart icon indicating the item count.

- **Real-time Search Suggestions:** Displays product suggestions matching user input, with clickable links to respective product pages.

- **Responsive Design:** Ensures a seamless experience across various screen sizes.

The Header component enhances user experience through intuitive navigation and easy access to essential functionalities.
